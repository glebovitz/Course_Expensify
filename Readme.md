# Expensify Example

This project was created as set of exercises for Andrew Mead's React course on Udemy.

## Expensify Todo:

1. Add confirmation modal when removing expense.
2. Show the number of hidden expenses in the dashboard summary.
3. Add support for additional social network login systems (facebook, github, etc);
4. Point a custom domain and configure it with Heroku (cname?)
